# Bellabeat
## Case Study - Google Data Certification
This project will show the steps I followed for the analysis of Bellabeat data set, as part of the completion of [Google's Data Certification course](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics).

In order to get familiar with working inside the R environment, no other  software has been used during the process.
I tried to add as many comments as possible so this document can hopefully help other students as well as serve as a consultation guide for my future self 🙂 🤓
